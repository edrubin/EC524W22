## What's different?

We've got a whole class on .hi-purple[prediction]. Why?

--

Up to this point, we've focused on causal .hi[identification/inference] of $\beta$, _i.e._,

$$\color{#6A5ACD}{\text{Y}_{i}} = \text{X}_{i} \color{#e64173}{\beta} + u_i$$

meaning we want an unbiased (consistent) and precise estimate $\color{#e64173}{\hat\beta}$.

--

With .hi-purple[prediction], we shift our focus to accurately estimating outcomes.

In other words, how can we best construct $\color{#6A5ACD}{\hat{\text{Y}}_{i}}$?

---
## ... so?

So we want "nice"-performing estimates $\hat y$ instead of $\hat\beta$.

.qa[Q] Can't we just use the same methods (_i.e._, OLS)?

--

.qa[A] It depends.
--
 How well does your .hi[linear]-regression model approximate the underlying data? (And how do you plan to select your model?)

--

.note[Recall] Least-squares regression is a great .hi[linear] estimator.

name: tradeoffs
# What's the goal?
## Tradeoffs

In prediction, we constantly face many tradeoffs, _e.g._,
- .hi[flexibility] and .hi-slate[parametric structure] (and interpretability)
- performance in .hi[training] and .hi-slate[test] samples
- .hi[variance] and .hi-slate[bias]

--

As your economic training should have predicted, in each setting, we need to .b[balance the additional benefits and costs] of adjusting these tradeoffs.

--

Many machine-learning (ML) techniques/algorithms are crafted to optimize with these tradeoffs, but the practitioner (you) still needs to be careful.

# What's the goal?

There are many  reasons to step outside the world of linear regression...

--

.hi-slate[Multi-class] classification problems
- Rather than {0,1}, we need to classify $y_i$ into 1 of K classes
- _E.g._, ER patients: {heart attack, drug overdose, stroke, nothing}

--

.hi-slate[Text analysis] and .hi-slate[image recognition]
- Comb though sentences (pixels) to glean insights from relationships
- _E.g._, detect sentiments in tweets or roof-top solar in satellite imagery

--

.hi-slate[Unsupervised learning]
- You don't know groupings, but you think there are relevant groups
- _E.g._, classify spatial data into groups

# Takeaways?

Any main takeaways/thoughts from these examples?

.note[Mine]

- Interactions and nonlinearities likely matter
- .it[Engineering] features/variables can be important
- .it[Related:] We might not even know the features that matter
- Flexibility is huge—but we still want to avoid overfitting
