# Classification, regression, resampling, and validation

Back to the 2016 election!

You will again attempt to predict which party 'won' (received the most votes) for each county in the US during the presidential election of 2016.

All the data you will need are stored in [`election-2016.csv`](https://raw.githack.com/edrubin/EC524W22/master/projects/project-002/election-2016.csv).

*Sources:* This dataset combines data from 

- [a Kaggle project for the 2016 election](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/2016-us-election?select=county_facts.csv)
- [MIT's election data and science lab](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ).

The outcome you are predicting  is `i_republican_2016`. This variable is a simple, binary indicator for whether Republicans won the given county in 2016. 

**Important:** For true classification methods (e.g., logistic regression), you will need an outcome variable that is `character` or `factor` (not simply a binary numerical variable). So you'll need to add another column to the dataset or transform the current column.

**Note:** You can work on this project however you like (RStudio, Kaggle, etc.). Just make sure you can submit (on Canvas) a nice document with your answers, R code, and figures. The submission can be a file (e.g., a knitted PDF) or a link (e.g., to a Kaggle notebook or hosted )

## Part 1: Penalized regression

**01\.** Using 5-fold cross validation: tune a Lasso regression model. (Don't forget: You can add interactions, transformations, etc. in your `recipe`. You'll also want to standardize your variables.)

**02\.** What is the penalty for your 'best' model?

**03\.** Which metric did you use to define the 'best' model? Does it make sense in this setting? Explain your answer.

**04\.** Now tune an elasticnet prediction model.

**05\.** What do the chosen hyperparameters for the elasticnet tell you about the Ridge vs. Lasso in this setting?

## Part 2: Logistic regression

**06\.** Now fit a logistic regression (`logistic_reg()` in `tidymodels`) model—using 5-fold cross validation to get a sense of your model's performance (record the following metrics: accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, ROC AUC).

*Hint:* You can tell `tune_grid()` or `fit_resamples()` which metrics to collect via the `metrics` argument. You'll want to give the argument a [`metric_set()`](https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/metric_set.html).

**07\.** What is the cross-validated accuracy of this logistic model? 

**08\.** Is your accuracy "good"? Explain your answer—including a comparison to the null classifier.

**09\.** What do the other metrics tell you about your model? Is it "good"? Are you consistently missing one class of outcomes? Explain.

## Part 3: Logistic Lasso

**10\.** Now fit a logistic Lasso regression (`logistic_reg()` in `tidymodels`, but now tuning the penalty) model—using 5-fold cross validation. Again: record the following metrics: accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, ROC AUC.

**11\.** How does the performance of this logistic Lasso compare to the logistic regression in Part 2?

**12\.** Do you think moving to a logistic elasticnet would improve anything? Explain.

## Part 4: Reflection

**13\.** Why might we prefer Lasso to elasticnet (or vice versa)?

**14\.** What the the differences between logistic regression and linear regression? What are the similarities?

**15\.** Imagine you worked for a specific political party. Which metric would you use for assessing model performance?
